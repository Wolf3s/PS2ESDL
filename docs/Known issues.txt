-In 480P mode, the background will be corrupted.
	The reason for that is a lack of VRAM. In order to be able to draw everything on the screen with gsKit with only 4MB of VRAM,
		the screen will have a resolution of 640x480 instead of 720x480.
	This causes corruption as 640 isn't a multiple of the screen length (1440 units, I think).
